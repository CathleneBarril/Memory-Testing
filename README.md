1.	Why do we need to perform memory testing?

    A memory test's objective is to verify that each storage place in a memory device is operational. In other words, if the number 50 is saved at a specific address,  
    you may expect to see it there until a different number is put to the same address. 

    Therefore, the fundamental notion of any memory test is to write a set of data to each location in the memory device and then read the data back to confirm it. The   
    memory device is deemed to have passed the test if every value read back matches every value recorded.
